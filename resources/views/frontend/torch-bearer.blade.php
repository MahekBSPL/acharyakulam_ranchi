                  <b>Yogarṣi Swami Ramdevji</b> was born to Smt. Gulab Devi and Shri Ram Niwas in a village of
                  Haryana. He
                  had his early education in a village school. At the age of 14 he was admitted to the Gurukul at
                  Kalwa (near Jind, Haryana) where under the blessed tutelage of Ācārya Shri Baldevji he studied
                  Sanskrit and Yoga, and earned a postgraduate (Ācārya) degree with specialization in Sanskrit
                  Vyākaraṇa, Yoga, Darśana, Vedas and Upaniṣads, later he was very much inspired by the life and
                  writings of Maharṣi Dayanand and he thoroughly studied Satyārtha Prakāśa, Ṛgvedādibhāṣyabhūmikā etc.
                  Along-side the magnetism of Maharṣi. Patañjali as an exponent of Yoga, Sanskrit Grammar and Āyurveda
                  continued to exert its influence on him.
                </li>
                <li class="mt-2 mb-2">Quite early in his life he had his goals cut out for him, so he chose the path
                  of celibacy and
                  asceticism. After doing a stint of teaching Yoga, Pāṇini’s Aṣṭādhyāyī and Patañjali’s Mahabhāṣya at
                  Gurukuls, he set out on his journey to the Gangotri caves of lofty Himalayas, away from the
                  distractions of mundane activities.</li>

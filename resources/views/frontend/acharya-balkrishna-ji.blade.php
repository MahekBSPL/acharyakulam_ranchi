                <h2>Acharya Balkrishna Ji</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Acharya Balkrishna</b>, a great scholar of Ayurveda, Sanskrit language and grammar, and the
                    Vedas, was born to Smt. Sumitra Devi and Shri Jay Vallabh.</b>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    During his journey and austere penance in the Himalayas, he was able to explore four rare and
                    extinct <b>astavarga</b> plants used as ingredients in the preparation of <b>cyavanaprasa</b>, an
                    ayurvedic tonic.
                    He is also credited with discovering the <b>sanjivani buti, the medicinal plant</b> of legendary
                    fame. As
                    the head of all the medical institutions and chikitsalayas (Hospitals and clinics) functioning under
                    the aegis of Patanjali Yogpeeth, he is mainly focused on the research and development of Ayurveda to
                    make it compete successfully with the modern medical science. He has been able to cure lakhs of
                    patients at his Brahmakalpa Chikitsalaya of several stubborn, chronic and incurable diseases like
                    diabetes, rheumatism, osteoarthritis, gout, migraine, cervical spondylitis, respiratory disorders,
                    asthma, cancer, nervous disorder, heart disease, brain diseases, etc. Yoga and Ayurveda have
                    combined wonderfully in the treatment of these diseases at a very nominal price. These successful
                    treatments have been documented by Acharyaji in his renowned book: <b>Yoga In Synergy With Medical
                      Science.</b> Another popular book written by him is <b>Aushadh Darshan,</b> a handy pharmacopoeia
                    of ayurvedic
                    and home remedies.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-12">
              <ul>
                <li>At the Department of Medical Science In Yoga & Ayurveda at Patanjali Yogpeeth, Hardwar, he has got a
                  team of 70 physicians to assist him. Besides, more than a thousand vaidyas (ayurvedic physicians) in
                  India and abroad are treating patients under his guidance.</li>

                <li>To ensure the efficiency of ayurvedic treatments, it was necessary to make pure and high-quality
                  medicines available to patients at an affordable price. Acharyaji took up the challenge and found
                  <b>Divya
                    Pharmacy</b> where Ayurvedic medicines with national and international certifications are
                  manufactured
                  with upmarket packaging. To ensure the use of genuine ingredients in the <b>Divya Pharmacy</b>
                  medicines,
                  <b>Patanjali Herbal Park</b> grows 450 medicinal plants (some of them rare) under the overall
                  supervision of
                  Acharya Ji.
                </li>

                <li>As a part of Swamiji's Bharat Swabhiman Movement, items of daily use like tooth powder, toothpaste,
                  hair oil, soap, shampoo, beauty creams etc. are produced in Divya Pharmacy & Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.
                  with Ayurvedic ingredients and Ayurvedic formulas.
                </li>

                <li>Acharya Ji's knowledge and experience in the managerial, administrative and engineering fields,
                  which has been admired by one and all in India is another aspect of his multi-faceted genius and
                  personality. The impressive infrastructure of Patanjali Yogpeeth buildings is a living testimony to
                  his grand futuristic concepts.</li>

                <li>His editorial skills can be seen in <b>Yog Sandesh</b> where, as the Chief Editor, he propagates
                  <b>yoga and
                    ayurveda</b> for the mental, physical and spiritual health of people. All his activities are
                  inspired by
                  this dictum of Bhagavad Geeta:
                  <b>“kamaye duhkhataptanam praninamartinasanam”.</b>
                </li>

                <li>He has also edited, collaborated and authored books like <b>Ayurved: Its Principles & Philosophies,
                    Secrets Of Indian Herbs, Vitality Strengthening Astavarga Plants, Vaidika Nityakarma Vidhi,
                    Yogadars'ana, Sant Darshan and Bhakti Gitanjali.</b>
                </li>
                <li>By devoting himself to the service of humanity in many ways, round the clock, he has become a true
                  <b>karmayogi.</b>
                </li>
